### Kernel

- OF: Open Firmware. This was invented long time ago when Apple was producing laptops based on PowerPC CPUs and Sun Microsystems workstations were still popular. Open Firmware provides a good description of the devices connected to the platform. In Linux kernel the part that works with device data is called Device Tree (DT). More details about DT in the [Usage model](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/usage-model.txt).
